  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a wannabe Front and Back End developer living in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
  <p>I've not done any regular coding since I was about 16 but I've been thinking about getting back into it for a long time and decided to finally take the plunge.</p>
  <p>I've got a grand plan to sell all my stuff and move overseas somewhere to live life as a digital nomad. I've set myself the goal of doing this within the next twelve months and plan to use the skills I develop in this course to setup a development business I can run anywhere.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I live in a leafy outer suburb of Melbourne, Australia (the home of the <a href="http://www.melbournecup.com" target="_blank">Melbourne Cup</a>, <a href="http://www.grandprix.com.au" target="_blank">Formula 1 Grand Prix</a> and the <a href="http://www.ausopen.com" target="_blank">Australian Open</a>).</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>Until I got lazy over the holidays I would have said going to the gym and running. They're two things I have to work on in the new year.</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>To travel the world on a whim, while working remotely either for a startup or working on a startup of my own.</p>
    <h2>What's important to you?</h2>
    <p>Staying healthy, travel, and constantly challenging myself.</p>
    <h2>What are you hoping to get from the Thinkful Front End course?</h2>
    <p>I'm hoping to validate some of the things I already knew, as well as develop a solid foundation in HTML, CSS and JS skills to prepare me for going further in depth in the future. </p>
